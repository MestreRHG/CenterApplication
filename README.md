# Center Application
Recenter the application of focus with a shortcut.

How it works
============
When you hit the shortcut ALT + B, the application on focus will be moved to the center of the monitor (works on a multiple monitor setup).

Installation
============
Go to releases, download the latest version, extract, and run it. Optionally, the zip comes with a bat file that adds the app to startup (starting from release 1.3).

Fork
============
If you want to fork, you can just download or clone the code, credits are optional.

Future (if it happens)
===========
Add a menu to configure the shortcut, if it works on 1 monitor or all.

FAQ
===========
How much time did this take you?
-----------
More than I would like to admit.

Will you update this?
-----------
I still need to learn C++, plus I like to finish what I start, so there is a possibility I add every feature I want to add.

What is your experience?
-----------
This is the second application I have released for learning purposes, therefor don't think the code is beautiful, but I guess it works.
