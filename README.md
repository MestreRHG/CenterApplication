# Center Application
Recenter the application of focus with a shortcut

How it works
============
When you hit the shortcut ALT + B, the application on focus will be moved to the center off the monitor (works on multiple monitor setup)

Installation
============
Go to releases and download the latest version

Fork
============
If you want to fork, you can just download or clone the code, credits are optional but thankful

Future (if it happens)
===========
Add a menu to configure the shortcut, if it works on 1 monitor or all
